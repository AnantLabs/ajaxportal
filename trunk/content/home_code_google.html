<h2>Overview of Ajax Portal Technology</h2>
Ajax Portal is technology for developing Web Portal which supports content aggregation from different instances (content of any HTML/XHTML resources in Internet). It's possible to use standard Web application as portlets. The server technology doesn't matter (Java , .NET, ASP, PHP, Perl, etc.).

                               <img src="http://ajaxportal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/ap2.jpg">

<h2>What is Ajax Portal?</h2>
I propose a new enterprise portal architecture (Ajax Portal) which is based on Ajax calls exclusively. It simplifies portlet creation and even allows to forget about portlets as portal server side components. Instead, I propose to use any static or dynamic HTML/XHTML resource as a portlet. It gives the possibility to use standard Web applications based on JSF, Tapestry, Struts 1/2, Webwork frameworks, and even non Java-based technologies, such as ASP, ASP.NET, Perl, PHP, etc. as portlets (content sources for portlets on the portal page).

Unlike portlet bridge (JSR 301), client side of Ajax Portal requests the HTML/XHTML resource (portlet) for both context and data.

Ajax portal uses subtechnology ajax4all (implementation of <b>Ajax Submit</b> pattern) for supporting the applications based on Lite Ajax pattern (the application uses standard controls of HTML form).

For resolving security issues (e.g. browser security and firewall rules) and/or opening secure channel, all Ajax requests can be sent through HTTP Repeater which retranslates request to the portlet server and response from the portlet server.

For possibility to use existing Web applications as portlets and for excluding the need to modify these applications, Ajax Portal has a special Content Aggregator component. This component allows to get the body of HTML/XHTML resource (content of the BODY tag) or content of any element of HTML/XHTML resource by value of id attribute for Content Injection in the portal page. Content Aggregator also extracts links and source of JavaScript and CSS and injects them in the portal page by a special method (specified by portal implementation).

All portlets of Ajax portal are set in portlet regions on the portal page. Each portlet has the RegionByDefault parameter, which specifies the region where the portlet will be added during portlet installation in the portal page. Ajax Portal allows to <b>Drag and Drop</b> portlets within the region and from one region into another. Region usage gives an additional possibility for portlet decoration (view of the portlet depends on states of both the region and the portlet). 


<h2>Main features</h2>
<b>Implemented features:</b>
    * Portlet content (HTML, XHTML, CSS, scripts, etc.) can be loaded by Ajax Calls directly from portlet server.
    * Portlet loading/working/updating is doing without reload of portal page.
    * Posibility to use standard Web application without changes as portlets.
    * Ajax Portal proposes Portlet API based on MicroServlet MVC framework for classic portlet development. Portlet API generally follows JSR 286.
    * Drag & Drop support.

<b>Technical features:</b>
    * Transformation of standard Web application to Ajax based application
    * Multyplatform development (support of Java, .NET and PHP platforms)

<b>Features in progress:</b>
    * Localization (Internationalization) for English, Russian, German (already supported).
    * Common wizards and dialogs
    * Security module
    * Personalization module


<h2>Why Ajax Portal?</h2>
Update of portlet content is executed by Ajax Call without reloading of the Portal Page. Usage of this approach saves Internet traffic between portal server and portlets.

Portal Page defines the layout (position of each portlet on portal page), but the layout can be changed by JavaScript library (clien side API).

Ajax Portal is Platform-independent and programming languages-independent (client side is implemented as JavaScript library (API), but server side can be based on Java, .NET, Perl, PHP, etc.).

Only Personalization Service and HttpProxy (HttpRepeater) components are required for Ajax Portal functionality. Both server side components have to implement interfaces described by Ajax Portal specification. Other services and components for server side are optional.

CMS is out of scope of Ajax Portal specification. Developer can use any CMS, databases and any other sources for content storing.

Ajax Portal adds additional component Region and a new decoration for portlets.

Ajax Portal JavaScript library (API) provides possibility to create, modify and delete any portlets and regions on client side (in the browser).

<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>

Ajax Portal proposes a little bit different terminology in comparison with JSR 286:

    * <b>Portal</b> is a Web application providing the content aggregation from different sources, personalization (implemented by PersonalizationService), security (e.g. Sing Sign On for relative Portlets) and the presentation layer of Information System.

    * <b>Ajax Portal</b> provides content aggregation of Portlets and any static (any HTML/XHTML page) or dynamic (any Java based, .NET, ASP, Perl, PHP, etc. application) resources from Internet.

    * <b>Portal Page</b> represents a complete HTML/XHTML document and aggregates several portlet regions and Portlets.
                               <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/portal_page_new.jpg">
                                                             Picture 2. Basic Portal Page components

    * <b>Content</b> is a set of components in HTML/XHTML document (e.g. text, images, links, etc.).

    * <b>Content Area</b> <i>(instead of Portlet Content in JSR 286)</i> is any rectangular bar with Content in HTML/XHTML document.

    * <b>Portlet</b> <i>(instead of Portlet Window in JSR 286)</i> provides decoration for the Content Area and additional behaviors (minimize, maximize, open in a new window, etc.). Usually any portlet has content and header with an icon, a title, some markers (e.g. draggable icon marker) and behavior buttons.

    * <b>Portlet Region</b> is a rectangular bar with <i>Portlet</i>s. <i>Portlet Region</i> provides decoration for the region and an additional decoration for the portlets in the region. <i>Portlet Region</i> also provides a special behavior for the portlets (e.g. portlet minimizing and maximizing,<i>Portlet</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop" target="_blank">Drag and Drop</a> between regions and inside of the region).<br><i>Portlet</i>s can be situated outside of <i>Region</i>s.

    * <b>Portlet Application</b> <i>(instead of Portlet Container in JSR 286)</i> is a server side component supporting request processing and dynamic content generating. Portlet Applications are used as pluggable user interface components that provide a presentation layer of Information System. Ajax Portal provides Java based default implementation of Portlet Application (see Portlet implementation module of Ajax Portal). Portal and Portlet Applications can be built together as one Web application.

<h2>Basic Architecture</h2>
<i>Ajax Portal Server</i> is a <i>Web Application</i> which provides a base portal page layout, a navigation mechanism and a change of the portal settings.<br/>
Architecturally <b>Ajax Portal</b> consists of two main parts:<br/>
    * the first one supports ordinary <b>Web Application</b>s by <b>Content Aggregator</b>,<br/>
    * the second one supports old model of <b>Portlet Application</b>s by <b>Portlet Connector</b>.<br/>
Client (browser) connects to the <b>Portal Web Application</b> using <b>HTTP</b>. <i>Portal Web Application</i> sends to client <b>HTML/XHTML</b> content to client.

<h2>Special Appeal #1: Region States</h2>

<i>Ajax portal</i> supports five states of <i>Region</i>s. Each region state provides a specific decoration for the <i>Region</i> and an additional decoration for the <i>Portlet</i>s in the <i>Region</i>.
    * <b>Nodecoration</b> view cancels all decorations of the portlets in the region.<br/>
        <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/container_nodecoration.jpg"><br/>
                                                             Picture 4. Nodecoration region state.
    * <b>Window</b> view represents the current region as window.
        The window has an icon and a title. 
        All portlets have no decorations in the region.<br/>
        <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/container_window.jpg"><br/>
                                                             Picture 5. Window region state.
    * <b>Standard</b> view is classic view of the portlet.
        Any portlet is decorated as small window with icon, title and behavior buttons.
        Set of buttons depends on the <b>Portlet View</b> (the buttons change the portlet state).<br/>
        <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/container_standard.jpg"><br/>
                                                             Picture 6. Standard region state.
    * <b>Accordion</b> view is decorated portlets in the region as multiple panes (one pane for one portlet).
        Each pane has the same header as classic portlet view except for behavior buttons (see Standard state) and content. 
        All headers are displayed vertically as horizontal bars.
        Only one pane can be selected at the same time.
        By default the first pane is active.
        Content of the pane is shown under the pane header.
        User can activate another pane by clicking on the corresponding header.<br/>
        <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/container_accordion.jpg"><br/>
                                                             Picture 7. Accordion region state.
    * <b>Tabs</b> view represents portlets in the region as multiple tabs (one tab for one portlet).
        Each tab has a header and a content.
        Usually the header has an icon and a title.
        All headers are displayed horizontally above the content.
        Only one tab can be selected at the same time.
        By default the first tab is active.
        User can activate another tab by clicking on the corresponding header.<br/>
        <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/container_tabs.jpg"><br/>

<h2>Special Appeal #2: Exotic Portlet Themes</h2>

<i>Ajax Portal</i> supports the following exotic themes for portlets in base package (see below). The themes are supported only for <i>Portlet</i>s outside of any <i>Region</i>.
    * <b>Alternative1</b> theme (there're no portlet icon and title)<br/>
      <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/portlet_theme_alternative1_new.jpg" alt="Alternative1 theme"><br/>
                                                             Picture 9. Alternative1 theme.

    * <b>Alternative2</b> theme (<i>Portlet Content</i> follows after the portlet title)<br/>
      <img src="http://sokolovbook.narod.ru/en/content/images/portlet_theme_alternative2.jpg" alt="Alternative2 theme"><br/>
                                                             Picture 10. Alternative2 theme.

    * <b>Alternative3</b> theme<br/>

<h2>Who Am I</h2>
I'm a lead software engineer with 18 years of development experience. My specialty is database and web development for business applications. Last 6 years I've been concentrated on the development under Java platform, though I had good experience C, C++, C#, VB (VBScript), Perl and Flash (action script and animation) development. I had system architect role on my two last projects. I had deep experience in architecture documentation development. 

I started my portal experience from WebLogic Portal 8.0 in 2005. 

I've already published 4 books:
||<img src="http://ajaxportal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/my_css3_bolgaria_book.jpg"> <b>[http://www.asenevtsi.com/index.php?p=book&book=46 CSS3 в примери + CD.]</b> 336 pages, 2009, Asenevtsi (Bulgaria).||<img src="http://ajaxportal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/my_css3_book.jpg"> <b>[http://www.williamspublishing.com/Books/978-5-8459-1337-1.html CSS 3 в примерах.]</b>352 pages, 2007, Williams (Russia).||<img src="http://ajaxportal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/my_html_and_css_book.jpg"> <b>[http://www.williamspublishing.com/Books/978-5-8459-1192-6.html HTML и CSS в примерах, типовых решениях и задачах.]</b> 416 pages, 2007, Williams (Russia).|| <img src="http://ajaxportal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/my_javascript_book.jpg"> <b>[http://www.williamspublishing.com/Books/5-8459-1029-3.html JavaScript в примерах, типовых решениях и задачах.]</b> 592 pages, 2006, Williams (Russia).||

You can ask me Why didn't I publish a new book in this year? The reason is Ajax Portal...

I joined the following ideas and proposals in Ajax Portal: 
    # my proposal of intranet console for EPAM and Exadel, 
    # small library for remake of my JavaScript book, 
    # experience of enterprise portal development, 
    # ALL components (region states in Ajax Portal).
