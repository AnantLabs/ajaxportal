== Way #1: You have Portal project ==

You can get from my project:
    * Portlet decoration (HTML+CSS+JavaScript)
    * JSP and JSF tags for Java based portals
    * Implementation of Portal API (based on JSR286)
    * Themes
    * Run-time wizards
    * Alternative way for portlets
    * Ajax4all library which gets possibility to use 

== Way #2: You have Java Portlet API ==

You can get from my project:
    * Alternative Portlet implementation (my implementation of GenericPortlet class extends from HttpServlet (only one principal difference  from  JSR 286), additional properties and methods for portlets and descriptor annotations)
    * Extents your API from my (I support my code(developing,  testing, fix issues)) or I extend my API from your API
I will concentrate on your PHP, .NET (C#, VB, etc), Perl code only.

== Way #3: You have CMS or JSP tags for CMS usage ==

I think the CMS is out of Portal scope and I doesnâ€™t plan develop my CMS.
I will use your CMS/CMS API/CMS Tags as default for my portal.

== Way #4: You have Portlets ==

I will put your portlets in my portal and add information about you, your site and your products/portlets.
